*These vessel lists were used for previous tile sets. For the vessel lists
used in current file sets see `treniformis.known_likely_fishing`.*

Combined vessels lists were created from likely fishing vessels (those identifying as fishing) and known fishing vessels from a combined set of registry sources. Most known fishing vessels are also on the likely fishing list. The likely fishing vessel lists used were based on a less restrictive filter for total number of positions so new combined lists should be updated here with the new threshold for likely fishing vessels. 

Known fishing vessels were identified from CLAV (combined tuna RFMOs), CCAMLR, and the EU registry by matching vessel identifiers to mmsi's. ITU and FFA fishing vessels were also included (mmsi is given in these registries).

The lists here should be replaced as we apply the new standard for selecting likely fishing vessels, improved matching methods that were not applied to lists other than 2015, and pull data from a larger set of available public registries.
