Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import treniformis
    treniformis.get_annual_list_path('GFW/WKV/FISHING/KNOWN/2016')


Developing
----------

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/treniformis
    $ cd treniformis
    $ pip install -e .\[all\]
    $ py.test --cov treniformis --cov-report term-missing


Lists
-----

Likely Fishing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generated from a query of vessels identifying themselves as fishing in the
``shiptype_text`` field in the vessel identity messages in the type 5 and type
24 AIS messages. Details of the query can be found in Benthos #397. In the next
round we will filter out some additional "unknown" vessel types and probably
drop the threshold to include some vessels that almost always identify
themselves as fishing.

Known Fishing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Based on `public fishing registry records <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15ICZzrkiaPPWV7sp0uytNnwXGRM8jTh6KjJ4026lDGU/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1259036802>`_.

Combined Fishing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Produced by combining likely and known fishing lists and then removing sets of
known non-fishing vessels (fish carriers, fishspotting helicopters, research
vessels) along with short mmsi's (less than 5 digits)  and mmsi's that will
likely have a large number of spoofing vessels (111111111). See Benthos #397.
